# C++ Logic & Simulation Projects

A collection of core C++ projects focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs), Data Structures, and System Design Simulations.

## 🛠️ Projects Included
1. **Elevator System Simulation:** A multi-class simulation using OOPs to manage lift movements and rider requests.
2. **Student Allocation System:** An implementation of the Gale-Shapley-like algorithm for college admissions using C++ Vectors and Maps.
3. **Railway Reservation Logic:** A simulation of ticket queuing and counter management.
4. **Date Utility System:** Operator overloading and logic to handle date differences and leap years.
5. **Snake & Ladder:** A classic game logic implemented using custom structures and recursion.

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **Language:** C++ (CPP)
* **Core Concepts:** Classes & Objects, Operator Overloading, STL (Vectors, Maps), Memory Management (malloc).
